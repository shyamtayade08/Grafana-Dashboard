# GitHub Repo Insights Dashboard using Grafana

### Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring solution that helps users create dashboards for visualizing time-series data. In this project, I have set up a dashboard that pulls data from my GitHub repository and displays useful insights for project monitoring and analysis.

* Repository Statistics: Visualize key metrics like number of commits, issues, pull requests, and contributors.
- Real-Time Data: Automatically updates with the latest statistics from the GitHub repository.
* Customizable Dashboards: Modify the dashboard to display any other relevant GitHub data.
